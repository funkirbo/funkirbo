postal's tough to really analyze to me.

i don't dislike what it's trying to go for, not at all. i think a fully insane person shooting their way through a complete mental breakdown is a really interesting concept, and postal executes it pretty decently. it's less that it's chastising you for shooting civilians, a la hotline miami, but you only benefit from killing those who oppose you. postal guy understands the difference between his obstacles and those simply in his way, and it's up to you to choose whether killing them is worth it.

my problem is that each of these levels often turn into mindless killings, which i guess is the point, right? it wants you to become completely desensitized to mowing down these people, spewing goofy one liners while ending the lives of hundreds. that mindlessness, though, often makes... y'know, *playing the game* pretty boring.

part of it, to me, at least, is the level design. i really wish there were some more varied obstacles in my way, alongside a more natural difficulty curve. i think that would add even more to the desensitization, of focusing more on the game rising difficulty than on the atrocities being committed on the screen.

there's something really special here, that i know for sure. some tweaking was in order to make this formula feel as it was supposed to, though, and because of that, i just can't fully invest myself into postal.
