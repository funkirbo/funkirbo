new super lucky's tale is not bad; i can't tell you that you won't enjoy it. if this kind of 3D platformer is your thing, you'll have a good time.

it's just so basic. there's no substance here in any way. any personality is nonexistent; the theming here almost feels like a template. all the bossfights - scratch that, the game as a whole - is pitifully easy. i think i may have lost 5 lives through my entire playthrough. the music is just fine as well.

i dunno, this game feels like a unity game template made by some expert as an example for beginners. there's nothing here that i feel compelled to go back to, ever. this one's probably gonna rot on my shelf for the rest of time.
