a much heavier political message to this dlc.

the base umurangi generation, to me, was about how the *world* reacted to the apocalypse. how the average family was impacted, how communities reformed and changed, how culture switched.

macro is an explicitly political tale about how the *elites* reacted. massive vip areas with strippers galore, weapons to stop the enemy that just send those most in need further down the dumps.

and that finale. hoo boy, that finale. finally giving in on being the good guys, wiping out an opposition that couldn't directly harm them.

68,412 dead. $2,273,282,281.38 spent. still, no hope.
