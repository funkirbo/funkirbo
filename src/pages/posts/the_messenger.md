a lot of faux-retro games don’t have a ton of stuff to do. their style takes precedence over the substance, and you end up with games that have low peaks and low valleys - games that range from mediocre at worst and decent at best. and those games are totally fine, they just don’t stand out very much. the messenger takes the retro style and runs with it, with excellent mechanics, a fantastic art style, and a narrative that weaves everything together surprisingly well.

structurally, it’s somewhere between a metroidvania and a traditional sidescroller. there’s a couple of different segments, each of which rewards the player with a new movement or combat ability. every segment is designed around that new ability, complete with a boss at the end of it. i think the easiest comparison is to something like ninja gaiden, which this game takes obvious inspiration from with its general theming and aesthetics. it’s a solid formula, which helps this game progress nicely.

after a “final boss”, the game turns into a time travel story, with the future being marked in a 16-bit art style. it’s a really neat twist narratively, but also plays a part mechanically. the game turns into more of a metroidvania, as you backtrack through worlds to find music notes. it changes up the formula quite a bit, as the game becomes a mad search to find the 6 missing pieces of the melody. i don’t love this new style, as you just have to scrape through every room to find new routes, sometimes you just get dead ends; it exemplifies all the worst elements of metroidvanias, with all of its backtracking. it’s still fun, don’t get me wrong, but it’s not quite as streamlined as the first half.

the game’s movement abilities help the rather slow-moving ninja feel really fun to control! whether you’re wall jumping around the map, grappling across the screen, or slashing your opponents’ projectiles for a second jump, your abilities play into the level design really well. despite the lack of speed, running through the levels doesn’t feel sluggish, because you rarely have to slow down if you play your cards right.

boss-wise, i love a lot of the enemies you face! there’s not a ton of super challenging fights, but each foe’s pattern feels unique and fun in its own right. whether you’re fighting a leafy monster or a pair of golems, a devil or a masked piano madman, each one is unique both in style and in attacks. they’re a treat, and one of the highlights of the game for sure.

you can head over to the shop to talk with the enigmatic shopkeeper, who helps you obtain new abilities through the skill tree. expanding your kit helps ease the difficulty down a bit, without feeling too cheap or anything like that. it’s a really well thought out skill system, that genuinely has some tough decisions on what to pick up and what to leave behind.

speaking with any of the characters, whether it be bosses, your village’s elder or any of the blue robes, is an absolute treat. each character is so silly, and surprisingly down-to-earth. the humor feels natural, like everyone is just joking around with each other. it’s a little meta, but not overwhelmingly so, which is nice. to me, the easiest comparison is a toned down undertale. the characters are less recognizable, but the humor style is similar, and it fits the over-the-top story the game goes for at the end.

your story is pretty basic to start. you’re a ninja, your village is in danger, and to “fulfill the prophecy”, you must deliver a scroll to the top of a mountain. once you make it to the mountain’s peak… a whole shit ton of time travel shenanigans ensue. there’s towers of time, more prophecies to fulfill, a magic melody and a trapped, demonic phantom to end it all. it’s pretty confusing, and the game knows that, so you end up getting quite a few exposition dumps, which i just can’t get behind. in concept, the time travelling story is really cool, and ties into the game’s art style in a really cool way. in practice, it ends up feeling extremely forced.

speaking of that art style, it’s really cool! the game starts as a traditional 8-bit style, but once you make it past the tower of time and start with the time travel stuff, the game changes to a more colorful 16-bit aesthetic. the new styling is only for the future, and as you switch between the future and the past, the styles switch alongside it. it’s a really neat way to use the limits placed on the game to its advantage, and makes a really unique twist once you reach the top of the tower of time. environmentally, the game looks fantastic as well. surprisingly great color depth for an 8-bit game, with excellent backgrounds as well. the tilesets help each area feel distinct and lush, and each area feels consistent while also feeling distinct.

i dunno, outside of some slight storytelling problems and some odd quest ideas with the notes, the messenger feels really solid to play. it’s a no-nonsense game that knows exactly what it wants to be and executes it really well. the combat feels great, exploration is solid, and the first half of the game is especially fun. while i wish the story was presented better, it’s still really cool conceptually, and the humor feels natural and silly. at the end of the day, no matter what problems i have, the game is really, really fun, so i can’t complain too much.
