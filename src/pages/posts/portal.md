it's damn hard to make a truly thrilling atmosphere without stepping into horror. it's a tightrope that many games fall off of, by either delving too deep into horror or not creating enough intrigue to keep players interested. portal walks that line perfectly.

visually, this game is incredible. the clean grey walls and white screens scuffed and dirty, the brown muck marring much of the floor throughout the labs. it all creates this vibe that you *really* shouldn't be here, yet here you are. even though nothing pops out at you, the suspense is built further and further as the game continues.

the lack of music through most of the game helps the visuals make the statement they need to. allowing you to sit in relative silence, the only sounds being ambient noise echoing through the halls, doubles down on the feeling of loneliness and isolation the game is trying to push.

glados's VA work is also incredible. her deceptive tactics hide behind a calm voice, and the only time you hear her break is as her "life" is coming to an end. it's perfectly unsettling.

of course, the puzzles are good too. the portal mechanics are fun and all that, but to me, the true virtue of portal is how it made me *feel*. an excellently unnerving, unsettling, spine-chilling experience that everyone should experience at least once.
