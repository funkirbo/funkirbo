there's moments throughout halo that left me speechless. beautiful landscapes and really neat structures are scattered throughout, and they're a really nice treat. the music and general sound design is fantastic, and the camera angles used for the large panning shots of each level are fluid and excellently done.

then i start playing the game, and it's... fine. even the more fun levels feel a little boring, as much of each level is just fighting enemies, then running for a bit.

it's especially noticeable in assault on the control room and the library, but it's a consistent pattern through the rest of the game. levels are defined by their big moments and interesting cutscenes, but a lot of the time, it feels like you're just walking between those big moments.

it's a landmark shooter, for sure, and i'm sure those big moments were worth the wait back in '01. playing it in the big '25, though, is a little disappointing.
