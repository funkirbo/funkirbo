if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it; just add a scooter.

yup, frog detective 3, at it’s core, is just another frog detective game. this time, though, you’ve got a scooter, and it’s absolutely amazing. the scooter allows you to explore the larger map that  is cowboy county, and the newfound exploration adds another layer to an extremely simple frog detective formula.

outside of that, frog detective 3 is also the longest game, with the most fun story in my eyes. whether you’re talking with a group of really friendly bandits or convincing cowboy county that crime isn’t real, the dry humor that makes frog detective stand out returns tenfold. the more old-timey areas are really fun, and the character’s eccentricities contrast really nicely to the white bread that is frog detective himself.

it’s the best the frog detective series has to offer, for sure. the scooter is a blast, the humor is still on point, and the story is filled with some more fun twists and turns that usual. it’s a good time!
