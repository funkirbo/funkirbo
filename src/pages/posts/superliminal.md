superliminal is confusing. it spends more time fucking with you... until it doesn't. it feels like descending deeper and deeper into an abandoned building, somewhere you shouldn't be, but at this point you're in too deep. turning back isn't an option, and as the hallways start repeating as you turn around, you just get more and more confused.

alarm clocks are blaring in your ears as time restarts, and restarts, and restarts, leaving you in an ever-descending world of decay. you watch as barriers that should be walls fall down, you find the backrooms of your world, rooms shrink into tiny setpieces to stare at. it's confusing, but compellingly so.

the complexity here isn't in its gameplay, it's in how the game functions on a large scale. you're not a victim of the environment any longer. shapes shift to your demand, as your perspective defines the world you're in.

it's great (until the ending, which i find a wee underwhelming).
