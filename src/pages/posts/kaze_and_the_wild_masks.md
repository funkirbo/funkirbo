kaze and the wild masks wears its inspiration on its sleeve; scratch that, it tattooed its inspiration across its face. kaze is basically a poor man's donkey kong country game. that's not necessarily a bad thing, though.

the level design is quite good throughout the game, the bosses feel climactic, there's plenty of stuff to collect, and the game feels pretty polished. also, weird compliment - the UI is like... really good. like surprisingly REALLY good.

the story doesn't make much sense, and i think the art and music are both just alright, but those complaints don't detract too much from a totally solid 2D platformer. it's nothing that'll shock you, but if you find it on sale, i'd pick it up. it's worth your time if this kind of 2D platformer is your thing.
