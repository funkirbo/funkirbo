it's so cute!! love the dungeons, and there's a ton of great content here. i do wish the bosses were a bit harder, because it's really the only (major) downside of the game.

love the small dating sim aspects as well, once again it's nothing crazy but it adds a ton more content to do and adds motivation to do more than the main story. i married river :)

as a zelda-like, all the mechanics you'd expect are there. there's some pretty neat puzzles, some fun dungeons, and awesome exploration. a little mechanically basic, but nothing that ruins the game.

it's not a mind-blowing game or anything like that, but it's surprisingly polished and a really solid time. you should play :D
