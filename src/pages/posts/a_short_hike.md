sometimes, life is hard. life will kick you in the dick and then claim that you hit them first. life will drop an anvil on your head and leave you there, alone.

a short hike is a comfy break from life. sit down, spend a little time talking with some people on the island, glide around, play some volleyball. enjoy it. it's only a couple hours long, perfect for those who just need a break. 

and, when you're ready to go back to the regular world, finish the climb. succeed in something, achieve something; then head back to life, feeling accomplished and refreshed.
