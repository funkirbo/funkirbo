i was a little surprised by just how funny this game was. every piece of dialogue is so incredibly stupid and dumb, every stat is buffed or nerfed by chugging some form of alcohol, it's just so unabashedly goofy and immature that i can't stop laughing.

unfortunately, as an rpg, it fails miserably. it's super basic, grinding is a massive pain in the rear, and a good chunk of the stats or abilities are basically useless. there's so much going on when almost nothing matters, to the point where the game offers to auto-level you up.

with better mechanics, this is an amazingly dumb time. as is, it's just comfortably good but not much more.
