there's nothing about tomb raider that makes me think "wow, am i happy to be playing this specific game."

it's fine. the story's pretty predictable, the characters aren't super deep, and the action and puzzles aren't super complex, but it flows together well and functions pretty well. i dig the cinematic feel, and you feel really cool when you're in a high-intensity movement area.

i had a good time playing through the game; fundamentally, it's not bad or anything like that. but if i want to play another game like this, there are plenty of other options that'll give me almost the exact same feeling.

also how on earth does lara come out of this game with no major injuries? she falls off multiple cliffs onto metal, wades directly through a full-strength river, gets stabbed multiple times, and then swims through blood and dirty water with OPEN WOUNDS and comes out fine. she's an archaeologist, not superhuman
