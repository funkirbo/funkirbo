really great metroidvania. bosses are the obvious highlight; they're ridiculously fun and pretty challenging. the general combat isn't anything crazy, as most enemies are stunned after one hit (outside of bosses obviously)

great visuals and music build an excellent atmosphere throughout, though the story feels pretty one-note and basic. most of the fun with progression comes with abilities you acquire, not the plot itself

i'd highly recommend this one to metroidvania fans. it's a bit punishing, especially at the start, but finishing it is endlessly satisfying
