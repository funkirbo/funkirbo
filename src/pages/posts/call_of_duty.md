for a war shooter made in 2003, this ain't half bad.

it's not a terrible game by any means, especially in the sound department. the surprisingly good voice acting and really well-crafted cinematic soundtrack work really well together.

i just don't love the base gameplay. it feels slow and more methodical than a lot of the other FPS games i've been playing recently, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but this game doesn't do anything super interesting with the more slow-paced playstyle. not that it's absolutely awful or anything, just rather boring.

i played COD '03 just to try out the call of duty gameplay style, since i don't play a ton of games in this lane, and all things considered, it wasn't terrible. it just doesn't do enough for me to want more of it
