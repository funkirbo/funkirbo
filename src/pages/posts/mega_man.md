the first mega man falls into a similar category as sonic 1 for me: a game with the vibes and "feel" down, with some absolutely atrocious level design.

except mega man's level design is consistently unfun, instead of sonic 1, which at least has green hill and star light zones. enemy placement is awful, the general platforming doesn't fit mega man's physics model, and the obstacles are far too tight, but not in a fun way. the bosses are great, at least!

there's some positives here, but it just feels a little undercooked. i used the legacy collection savestates and rewind pretty often, due to the rather poor level design. the levels were challenging, but more in the annoying way, not in the fun way, yknow?
