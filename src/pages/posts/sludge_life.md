sludge life, sludge life

sludge life is one of those "lowkey indie open worlds" that have been popping up within the last couple of years. instead of being cozy and cute, though, it's a piss-infested mess of graffiti and drugs. i'm here for it.

it runs off vibes entirely. hazy, vaporwave music with crt filters and a generally dreamy atmosphere make you feel like you're inside of a microwave, something i generally quite like.

not super deep gameplay-wise, but i think it's made for people to rip a fat bong hit and fuck around for a few hours. it definitely achieved that goal lol
