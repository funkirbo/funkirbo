a fantastic game, hindered by a lack of polish.

i'll start with my quick critiques:
- the movement kinda sucks. jumping especially feels like shit
- the worlds can be very, very confusing at moments, especially hollow bastion
- gummi ship kinda sucks lol
- fighting behemoth 4 fucking times

that's really it, and all of those (outside behemoth, fuck that boss) are easily fixable in a game moving forward. despite it's corniness, the story was really nice and hit pretty hard when it needed to. i like the light vs. darkness theming, and while it sometimes felt like 8 year olds larping, the campiness helped it feel more fun than annoying.

exploring through these different disney worlds, playing through a reimagined story, is fun every time! the characters feel accurate to the movies (of what i've seen), and watching sora, a generally normal kid, interact with these characters was pretty silly.
