after the absolute masterclass that was frog detective 1: the haunted island, grace bruxner and co decided to continue making their amazing pieces of art with a sequel or two. thus, frog detective 2: the case of the invisible wizard was born, another frankly incredible mystery that expands on what made frog detective so charming in the first place.

once again, i jest slightly: frog detective 2 is not one of the greatest games of all time. it is another installment in the quirky series of visual novels, best known for some pretty silly dialogue and fun character design. it’s nothing that’ll blow your mind, once again, but it’s a fun playthrough for it’s one hour runtime.

the frog detective general formula returns from the first: run around, talk to various members of the town, and connect the dots to figure out the mystery. it’s not all that complicated, but because the story is meant to be at the forefront, the simple gameplay works fine. exploring the vast, low-poly environments are an absolute treat, being able to explore the town of warlock woods as much as you like.

this game also adds a journal! frog detective marks down all the people he meets, as well as any clues or objectives he may receive. it’s really cute, and decorating the journal at the start of the game brings the whimsy of decorating a notebook that i only get to do a couple times a year. all the stickers are really cute, and opening up your hand-designed notebook is a feeling second to none.

the actual story is nothing wild, once again, but it’s just as cute as the first game’s narrative. there’s a new villager in town, a quieter little wizard, and there’s been some mysterious happenings with the welcome party for them. frog detective, the second best detective, is on the case! just as goofy and meaningless as the last game’s mystery, but my god, it’s also just so adorably silly. each character is wacky but clearly trying their best to be welcoming, and while they fail in a variety of ways, their efforts are in the best of intentions.

while the runtime is short, the mystery doesn’t overstay its welcome. an hour is perfect for a game this simple. had it gone more in depth, i think a lot of the whimsy that a game like this had would be lost. the simple, rather 1-dimensional characters would become annoying, and the objectively simple mystery would just drag.

it’s cute. frog detective 2 is cute, just as cute as the last game. mechanically, it’s very much the same as its predecessor, but the fun new story and characters are an absolute blast. i was smiling the entire time, and while the game as a whole wasn’t earth-shattering, i appreciated another venture into the frog detective world, if just to lighten my mood.
