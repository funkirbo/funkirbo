if frog detective has no fans, i am dead, because this game is PEAK!

okay, i jest slightly. frog detective is a fantastic game… for what it is. it’s a simple, goofy, one-note story that just wants to mess around with silly characters. and, honestly, it does that perfectly! the characters are super goofy, with fantastic and memorable dialogue, and you can mess around as much as you desire. it just doesn’t have much more than that going on.

you are frog detective, the second best detective in the local police force. you’ve been tasked to find the root of some ghastly noises happening on someone’s remote island. could they be paranormal? is the island… haunted? i adore how simple and silly the base concept is, and combined with the game’s super relaxed tone, a rather boring premise becomes a quest to find the source of the islandgoer’s plight.

speaking of tone, this game’s humor is absolutely fantastic! it’s all very dry, almost kiddy at times, but in the best way. it’s a rare game that’s made for adults, but works fantastically for your kids too. like, would kids understand the humor in the walking advertisement that is Fresh X and his toothpaste? maybe not. but would kids appreciate the talking alligator and his silly obsession with brushing his teeth? yeah, absolutely! nothing here feels condescending as an adult, but it’s also not complicated enough to be confusing if a 5 year old were playing it.

each of the characters on the island are an absolute joy to talk to! whether you’re talking with mysterymonkey, the biggest fan of your blog, or fresh x, a walking toothpaste advertisement, every character is just as silly as the last. the dialogue is written like a bunch of the most mature 7 year olds you’ve ever met talking to each other; it’s still a bunch of 7 year olds, but without a lot of the stuff that makes talking to 7 year olds so miserable.

as frog detective, your goal is to uncover the mysteries of the haunted island. to do so, you’ve gotta walk around to all of the guests of the island, solving their problems either through simple conversation or through grabbing an item. once again, it’s nothing complicated, but this format allows the story to shine, and encourages talking to all of the residents to get their piece. it’s an extremely basic visual novel mechanically. you’re just picking up items, talking to people, and… actually, that’s about it. there’s not a ton actually happening, honestly.

there’s not really much more to say. it’s an hour long, and it’s just meant to be a silly little experience. it’s fun for its short runtime, with great characters and a goofy plot. go buy it!!
