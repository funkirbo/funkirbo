post-apocalyptic games usually take on a much... darker tone. granted, that makes a hell of a lot of sense; the world ending isn't exactly a laughing matter. but it's interesting to take a look at a post-apocalyptic game that doesn't take on an explicitly grim view about the end of the world.

now, that's not to say umurangi generation isn't cynical; in fact, it's extremely extremely obvious that the collapse of society was accelerated due to poor decision making by the UN. but the game looks at the end of the world from a more reflective tone. what will the end of the world look like? how do people still manage to keep their lives somewhat together in a world falling apart?

umurangi generation has problems, sure. the game's physics are pretty janky, and the objectives feel... out of place, at times. but the game thrives where it needs to; creating an excellent atmosphere, better than almost any game i've played in a long, long time.
