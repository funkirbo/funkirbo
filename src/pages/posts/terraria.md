if i'm fully and totally honest, this playthrough was maybe the most fun full playthrough of a game i've ever had. so you may be thinking: why on earth is this not a 10?

well that's because i played this game with a friend in co-op (thank you Crynn). he is as close to an expert as i know, and has way more experience in this game that i do. this game was so fun because he helped me out in every way.

playing this game blind would be hell on earth. there's so many intricacies, weapon upgrades and random shit that no new player would ever know about because *why the hell would you*. that's the biggest problem with the game; the barrier for entry is extremely high.

i do have some slight problems with grinding, but that's to be expected for a game like this. other than that, though, terraria is a blast if you know what you're doing. the weapons are consistently fun to use and there's a ton of variety in between weapon and armor classes. the bosses are an absolute joy, especially moon lord.

the game is great... if you can get past the barrier of entry. and unfortunately, that barrier of entry is taller than the empire state building.
