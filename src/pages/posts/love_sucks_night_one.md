it's a totally fine, incredibly short "chapter one" to a longer game. is it mostly porno stuff? yeah. is that a terrible thing? not necessarily.

the art is really nice looking. it's a pretty cute little story, and the characters aren't half bad in their own right. it's not the game i'd expect to dive deep into self-confidence and filling a specific role in society, but the general themes are nice and provide a good through line for the game to follow. the main guy isn't quite as bland as the usual protagonist for a game in this genre, so that was a nice shakeup as well.

the CGs are really nice as well, with some beautiful art and totally... fine voice acting. as a whole, the art and styling of this game in general are well defined, with great sprites and backgrounds, alongside the moodier color choices.

it is clear, though, that this game is made by a small and relatively inexperienced team. it's not the best looking game in the UI department, and the music is all royalty-free stuff that they grabbed online. it makes the character moments a lot less impactful when i hear kevin mcleod in the background.

it's cute, it's free, and if you really want to play a porn game, it's there. i'm really not sure *why* i dove into this one, but i did, so here we are.
