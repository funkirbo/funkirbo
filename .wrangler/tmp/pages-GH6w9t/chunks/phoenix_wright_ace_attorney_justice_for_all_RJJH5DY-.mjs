yeah, turnabout big top is a fever dream, in the worst way. the gang takes a trip to the circus, and there’s… a love triangle with a 15-year old, gravity-defying murders with dubious motives, and the single worst cross-examination in the series! wonderful! it also holds very little bearing to the overall story through the game, outside of giving franziska some more screen time. it is atrocious, and possibly the worst case in the series.</p>\n<p>and after that, we get a masterpiece. farewell my turnabout is the first case phoenix defends on blackmail. he’s defending a guilty client, only because maya’s held hostage. he’s badgering witnesses for more time, harassing them about their mentor’s suicide, all to stall for time. edgeworth’s return sees him more matured, and it takes a complete reevaluation of his lawyerly mindset for phoenix to find the truth. his client is guilty, and he can get maya back. franziska turns, despite her hostility, into an essential piece of the investigation. everyone comes together to help each other out, despite their differences. it feels like it should be preachy, but it isn’t. it feels rewarding.</p>\n<p>and… the post-credits. miles meets franziska in the airport. her perfect record, her perfect lifestyle is broken… and she breaks. reworking your entire world view is hard, especially on someone so young. at just 17, her entire life is starting over. so she cries. she allows herself to break, likely for the first time in years. it’s absolutely gutting… but also extremely gratifying, to see her actively want to move towards a future where she’s a better lawyer, and a better person.</p>\n<p><strong>SPOILERS END - - - - - - - - - - - -</strong></p>\n<p>there are positives here, for sure. the final case is wondrous, there are extremely personal character moments throughout each case… yet it feels inconsistent. turnabout big top is just too bad, and kills the engaging feeling brought by the second case. for every perfect emotional beat, there’s a poorly executed one. the highs are high, and the lows are low.</p>\n<p>to me, there’s still more good than bad here. the overall character development is still fantastic, and there’s still 2 really great cases here. the gameplay is vastly improved as well, and the music and visuals are also excellent. it’s just not up to par with the first game in the mystery-writing department; not even close.</p>";
