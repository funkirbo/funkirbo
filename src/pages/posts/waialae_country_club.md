i don't know how to critically analyze this kind of game.

like, in the grand scheme of golf games... this sure is one of 'em. you golf. it's got all the options you'd expect; none of them feel awesome or impactful, but they're, in fact, there. it's a little too easy to top out, sure, but nothing wild.

it's just that this game is so, SO dumb in the weirdest ways. there is no music while golfing (i aided my ears by listening to Secret Formula by Kash Krabs on repeat), but then the sound effects for the introduction are so over-the-top. the intro SCREAMS "we paid our translation team 4 pennies and rolled with it." the settings options are atrocious and make no sense. nothing here lines up!!

so, is waialae country club bad? ...yeah, probably. but at least it made me laugh a lot. like, a Lot.
