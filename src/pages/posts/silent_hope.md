silent protagonists can be great. in games where the world is more important than individual characters, or when the developers want to make the player feel more deeply connected in the game, a silent protagonist can do wonders.

a silent protagonist (or more accurately, a *set* of silent protagonists) does not work for a game like Silent Hope.

according to the story, these are 7 powerful fighters drawn to the cursed abyss, who create a small town in order to conquer the hole and free the king at the bottom. which, in concept, isn't a bad premise.

as the title of the game suggests, though, every one of the characters has no dialogue until the post-game, which makes caring about the day-to-day of these characters extremely, extremely difficult.

the game is also mechanically lacking and quite boring, but that's not as fun to talk about.
