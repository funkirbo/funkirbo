it's rare for a game to leave a bad final impression. usually, you save the best for last, y'know? the big, flashy moment is right at the end.

clustertruck leaves maybe the worst possible final impression of any game i've ever played. a final boss about 3x longer than any individual level in the game, 10x more difficult, and 100x more infuriating. it's not even hard in a fun way!! it's just boring and gets difficult 2 minutes into each attempt.

the rest of the game? fine. okay. a totally acceptable, if a little unpolished, fast-paced platformer. totally perfect for youtube video b-roll footage, and decently fun when the game's level design gets trickier. but my god, what an absolutely abhorrent final impression. it leaves a bad taste in my mouth that i just can't get rid of.
