i feel like AAI as a whole struggles from the problem that many of the less fun traditional ace attorney cases struggle from.

many of the case-specific characters aren't all that good, sometimes case logic can get thrown out the window, investigations can get tedious at points, the usual. none of these problems are deal-breakers on their own; i can put up with shaky logic or slow investigations or mediocre characters. unfortunately, all 3 for most of the game makes it just kind of... boring.

all the cases being connected by one large overarching enemy, that being the smuggling ring, is an interesting twist on the AA formula. unfortunately, i can't bring myself to care about this smuggling ring when i have *0 fucking clue* what they're smuggling until the final case. the problem isn't the premise; it's the execution.

the logic and deduction mechanics are pretty interesting, but i think the way they're used is... just kind of odd. it never feels like you're ever connecting the dots when it matters; the deductions you make never feel all that challenging. 

once again, none of these problems ruin the game on their own; it's a *death by 1000 paper cuts*-type deal. the ace attorney games of the past deal with a couple of these problems, at most, while AAI has all of them, all at once.

now, this is still an ace attorney game. many of the positives of the series are still here; witty writing, excellent main characters (especially kay, she's great), great visuals & music.

i can't call this game bad. i can and *will* call it the most flawed of the traditional ace attorney games i've played so far (i say traditional because the layton crossover is an abomination). i would still absolutely play it if you enjoy the series, because it is still more ace attorney. it's not by any means bad; just more obviously flawed than the rest.
