i'm a big fan of games that tackle serious topics like anxiety and PTSD, and this short little VN does just that... almost too well.

i really like the atmosphere, the all-red visuals and disjointed, noisy background sounds pair nicely with the topic at hand. it's messy, but in a specific, purposeful way.

my problem arises with this game just being... a little *too* on the nose, y'know? like, this kind of atmospheric storytelling works much better when there are more questions than answers. i was more of a fan of the first half, because i really didn't get those answers. as soon as you sit down and are explained "here's exactly what happened. here is what's wrong with me, when it started, and what i'm doing now", a lot of the intrigue and surprise that this story could bring is lost.

i still understand the character and their struggles, but a lot of the punch that i want out of this type of game is lacking after that point.
