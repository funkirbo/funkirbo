man, this game rocks. or rolls, more accurately

it's just so silly and out there but in the best way possible. none of it feels forced, it's just kinda like that. running over cities as a teletubby-looking prince of the stars? yeah, that's just a normal monday here. all the conversations and cutscenes are so casual for how batshit insane this game is, and i think that's what makes it so good.

it's one of the few games that looks down on the player in an obviously joking manner, and i LOVE that. it just adds to the goofiness when the guy that isn't doing shit just says "wow, that was just okay. try better next time"

incredible (and i mean INCREDIBLE) soundtrack, a unique artstyle, all of it adds to this sense of charm and humor. it's not for everybody, but if this kind of humor and stupid bullshit makes you laugh, give it a playthrough.
