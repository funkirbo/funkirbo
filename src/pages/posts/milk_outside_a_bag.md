the first milk game, to me, was a little too blunt in its messaging for its themes to hit as hard as i would like. this game corrects that flaw stunningly.

our main character's plight, dealing with a litany of mental disorders, self-esteem issues, and general agony, is now put on display in a way completely different than her trip to the convenience store. we get to explore her home life, a complete mess that she calls home. exploring her life experiences through her room is a fever dream, stories of online friends who abandoned her, schools that she's been dragged out of, sketchbooks she rarely draws in.

all these traits show a deeply troubled young woman, one whose mental struggles force her to push her past behind her. she's scared: scared to move on, scared to stay in the present, and scared to ruminate in her past. she's scared of every option, so she stays frozen in the present, stuck in a room she refuses to change.

in the meantime, she talks to you, some sort of in-between of a person and her inner psyche. you can encourage her activity, or belittle her further, and it makes little difference. she's no happier, as she refuses to make any changes herself. her mind is trapped in an endless cycle of torment, and nothing you can do will change that.

the entire game is like this. whether you're out on the balcony of her spiraling apartment complex, or wrapped up in front of her mirror, you make no headway. the most you'll get is a new story from her, maybe another tidbit into the life she used to live. but that's long behind her.

the game is about trying to make her a little happier. or, at least, that's what's on the tin. in reality, you're really just an observer. sure, you interact, but at the end of the day, her actions are much the same every time. she may die, but she'll always be back. she may fall asleep, but she'll always awake. she may explore her past, but she'll never reflect on it. both you and her are stuck in this tango; you're trying to help, her mind is stopping her from doing anything with said help.

so you watch. you watch, as she pushes you away, preferring the silence she's used to. she stops taking her meds. you'll be gone tomorrow.

you keep watching. watching her dreams, as she delves further into the abyss.

you keep watching, as she wakes up, crying her eyes out.

and the game ends there. you failed. she's no happier than the start. why did you even bother?
