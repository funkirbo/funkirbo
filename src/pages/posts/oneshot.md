the inherent idea of oneshot is contrary to what many games strive to do; most games strive to give you new things to do, new areas to explore, new items to get. they want to keep you in a chokehold for as long as they can.

oneshot is a brief game - 3 or 4 hours on an initial playthrough, maybe 6 if you do the secret ending. many short games have a new game plus, or post-game content for you to sink your teeth into. maybe you can go back to early areas and wrap up some sidequests.

oneshot doesn't. it's a freaky, fourth wall shattering, bittersweet experience that removes the feeling of closure that games usually end with. finishing this game isn't satisfying; it's saddening.
