garden story is just cute. it's not mechanically deep, it's not a story that'll blow you away, but it's a silly little time in itself.

following concord around the vast grove, just talking with the silly little fellas and doing their quests, is fun! i didn't actually mind some of the busy work, most of the time it was fun, and it encouraged me to explore and find new quests to do. i do wish there was some more variety in those quests, especially because you'll be doing them *a lot*, but it's no biggie

the story is also really well presented! it feels less like a "world-ending" scenario, and closer to a community broken apart. your goal, for most of the game, isn't to "save the grove" - it's to rebuild communities lost. it's to help with small things, with building bridges and re-opening trade routes. even at the end, as the larger threat comes into play, the main themes of recreating bonds are still present! it's cute, and well-told.

i dunno, garden story won't blow you away. it's not a game that's mind-blowing or revolutionary, but it's a fun, cute little experience that i think is worth it :)
