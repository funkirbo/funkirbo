it's 1993. you just started playing *doom*, and you LOVE it. you talk to your friend about it, because, frankly, you just want to tell someone how cool this game is.

"so you shoot all these demons, right? they come from hell dimensions and portals and stuff! you can give 'em a big old punch and BAM! they explode! you've got shotguns, you've got machine guns, hell, one of the guns just kills em all! the game just blasts some hardass music and its super awesome! it's so cool!"

in their mind, what they imagine is doom *2016*, which is, in fact, a game where you have shotguns and machine guns, and spend all your time just shooting wave after wave of demons. looks great, sounds better, it's a little mindless, but a blast. 

when they show up to your pc, in its cream colored perfection, and you boot up doom *1993*, they're a little disappointed; less so in the game, and more so in their expectations.
