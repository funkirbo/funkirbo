I AM A GODDAMN PEGGLE MASTER!!!!!!!!!!!!

peggle is dumb. it's stupid. there is no reason this game should be fun in the slightest. it's 55 glorified pachinko machine levels with silly powerups and weirdly uncanny theming.

and yet, here we are: i finished peggle in a single afternoon, that flew by FAR faster than it should have. the levels are designed weirdly well, like small puzzles. sometimes you'll figure it out, sometimes the ball will bounce halfway across your screen 6 times and it'll finish it for you. i enjoyed both.

but i can't in good conscience say peggle is fantastic or anything. fun, sure, but incredibly random and slightly frustrating at times. it is the definitive "arcade" experience and i both love and slightly dislike it for that reason.
