superhot vr feels like a game made for vr, which is why it's so interesting that it was adapted from a traditional pc release. it's an excellent shooter that uses the benefits of vr beautifully; a lot of these traditional singleplayer games fail to understand *how* vr can enhance a game, but superhot nails it.

there's a great buildup of tension throughout each set of levels. being in vr is almost a punishment; any small movements may advance the time, so most of this game is spent planning out set patterns and ways to attack enemies without succumbing to your inevitable death. it's a one-of-a-kind experience, especially for vr.

i did accidentally punch my wall pretty hard though so i do have to dock half a star. the dent is permanent
