guess what? frog detective 2 is just more frog detective. this time, instead of a haunted island, you’re stuck in the whims of the woods, solving the mystery behind a ruined welcome party. it’s  just as goofy of a premise as the first, so of course, frog detective is back on the case.

the characters are still great, with some fun new faces to chat with, chock full with the same dry humor that made the first game stand out. frog detective is fun as well, and his sleuthing skills are just as “sharp” as always. this time, he’s got a journal to help him mark down suspicious characters or evidence, and customizing/using that journal is fun in its own right.

it’s frog detective 2, exactly what you’d expect from the titular detective. another simple yet fun romp that’s only about an hour long, perfect for people of all ages.
